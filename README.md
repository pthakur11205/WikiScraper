# Project Title

WikiScraper

## Description

Welcome to the WikiScraping program. Starting with a wiki article, this program continuously scrapes by selecting a random article link to scrape. This leads to an endless cycle of scraping
while printing titles along the way, so you can see how quickly one can websurf on Wikipedia.

### Examples of program function:

I decided to start with the wiki article for Batman, when I ran the code:

We went from Batman to a Business School in India!
